WORKING DRAFT: AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATION TO AUTOMATE CONSTRUCTION
======================================================
					Uwe Jens Cerron
### Abstract 
 
Recent occurrences over the past few years such as Matt Greer’s Carlisle Group and Pinnacle Housing Group’s inflated prices have undermined the trust in the affordable housing industry. Currently there is no system in place to audit the procurement process or progress in real time of a construction project. A lack of transparency throughout the procurement cycle, including bid announcements, project requirements, and the status of bid evaluations and awards, creates opportunities for improper influence and corruption by bidders.
 
A decentralized digital cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum that depends on a vast computer network to build a dependable ledger called the Blockchain could be better described as a chain of being sure about things. The Blockchain is a public distributed ledger which purpose is to facilitate trust-free transactions without having parties to know one another and verifiable by any party outside such transaction. 
 
A programmable Smart contract on top of this blockchain technology would allow to select the most reputable and price efficient vendor automatically. A smart contract is a term that can refer to a type of legal contract that can automatically perform some action. In this case the automated legal contract would require all parties to be identified with digital signatures and would stamp the transaction on the blockchain making its existence known and verified from anywhere in the world.
 
In this paper we propose a platform that adds complete transparency at each step of the design, procurement, and construction process with an underlying token with the ultimate goal of optimizing construction cost across of projects in said platform. This proposed construction engine will facilitate a custom smart contract between an investor and a developer on a given project with complete transparency throughout the development process while allowing for collaborative practices for building design and construction across all parties in the supply chain.
 
 
Introduction - The Trust Machine
-----------
 
The decentralized digital cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin depends on a vast computer network to build a dependable ledger called the Blockchain. The Blockchain is a public distributed ledger which purpose is to facilitate trust-free transactions without having parties know one another.
The value proposition of the blockchain is that trust is not required from a central entity, as it relies on the mathematical principles of public key cryptography. Transactions can be verifiable by a user’s public key. 
 
But aside from that programmable contracts can be written on top of this decentralized ledger. Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary. Assume there is a bid open for negotiation. A smart contract would be able to select the lowest bidder after x amount of time without human intervention.
 
A lack of accountability in the purchasing and hiring decisions by procurement management in private and public projects creates risk of procurements that are unnecessary or uneconomical.
Increase oversight, transparency and tracking of pre-bid activities by maintaining a searchable and audible digital records of inputs of estimates could be provided using Blockchain technology with smart contracts automating the selection of reputable price efficient vendors.
 
 
II. The Universal Constructor System
 -----------
 
In this case the purpose of a smart contract is to see the a building project come to life. The contracts may also set out the rights and duties of the parties involved: what each may do and what each must do. It also sets out procedures for specific cases e.g. what the manager should do if the contractor is not getting things done on time. The use of blockchain technology adds complete transparency at every phase of the design, procurement, and construction process. 
 
The focus of this system is to promote crowdfunding investment opportunities offered by companies, organizations and projects that opt to fund their development through newly issued tokens while optimizing construction materials and labor cost after each iteration.
 
 
Section 1 Stakeholders and Tokens
 
The Universal Constructor System will consist of tokens that member developers will issue. Investors who buy the tokens have the option to be idle and have their funds be used for the Universal Constructor System (UCS) proposals. If an individual, or a group of token holders disagree with a proposal at any point in time. They can retrieve their portion of ether before the proposal gets executed. They can submit and approve a proposal to form a new Autonomous Constructor System. They can then split the Universal Constructor System moving their portion of ether into the new proposal, leaving the old community alone.
 
Given that construction cost depends on labor, materials among other factors and is usually given in terms of price over an area and subject to variations due to the supply and demand in labor and materials among other factors. In order to assure token price stability. The Universal Constructor fundamental token of will be pegged to the US dollar. Each project will have a different cost per square foot depending on the requirements, location and the forces of supply and demand for labor and supplies at that time. 
 
Tokens will be used for governance of a project in the same way as a average investment vehicle. Representative of a fund where the more tokens a user has has the more voting power the user will have.
 
 
Section 2 Token Creation and Governance
 
The token creation process takes place when a company offering a construction project (developer) chooses to enter into a legally binding agreement with the members of the Universal Constructor. The Universal Constructor must then run strict checks on the developer wishing to participate in the Universal Constructor System. Once the developer is approved, the UCS will be entering a legally binding contract whereby the developer promises to complete the work and enforce digital reporting on all parties involved in the design, procurement and build out of the project.
 
This will provide a transparent ledger detailing the current state of a given project and verifiable by the blockchain. The token creation process mechanism is trivial and is meant to be used as a governance system to represent stakeholders on a given project.
 
Section 3 Quality of Service
 
A performance fund will be set aside made up of a fee from every token issued from every project. Should a member developer or vendor default during a phase of a given project. Another local member developer or vendor will take its place.	
 
 
III Funding
 -----------
 
The construction development units that are sold through UCS will help fund affordable housing developments. The value and performance of these tokens will be guaranteed by UCS developer members. The buyer of these tokens can either sell them to another party or use them to have a stake in the construction project.
 
The funds would be converted to US dollars that developers will receive immediately to build affordable housing communities to begin the construction process. Anonymity will be discouraged by adhering to KYC rules as well as requiring investor identification. 
 
 
IV  Future Work
 -----------
We plan to develop a publicly accessible web-based or mobile platform to improve end-to-end transparency in the procurement cycle. Such a platform should be implementable across all projects offered by the UCS and present information such as: reports on all solicitation schedules, tender opportunities, bid results and ongoing contracts as well as information on management structure, bids, ongoing contracts and winning bidders as well as up to date labor and materials cost information. Whistleblowing channels to report suspected misconduct by vendors or developers directly to procurement authorities. Lastly, we aim in exploring further BIM technologies and its integration with the blockchain in the future.
 
V. Conclusion
 -----------
Most companies do not have the scale to conduct adequate due diligence programs, as a result, they do not have sufficient understanding of the reputational and compliance risks associated with vendors/ suppliers they do business or place in their supply chains. Not to mentions they might get a higher cost by operating independently of one another. This puts investors funds at risk. Moreover, monitoring of this supply chain is not openly accessible by investors and they might not be able to know of a misconduct of funds until it is too late. This paper proposes a system where labor and vendors might be reused across developers achieving economies scale like they have never had before while providing a real time integrated report through Ethereum’s blockchain.
